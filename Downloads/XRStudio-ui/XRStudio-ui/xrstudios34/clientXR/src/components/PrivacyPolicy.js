            To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use
            "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to
            assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification
            (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the
            Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself
            (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing
            who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only
            personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply
            (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope).
            A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may
            also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their
            ads), a process that we do not control.

            computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data --
            such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify
            you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to
            you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users,
            to measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know the
            geographic locations from where our visitors come.
